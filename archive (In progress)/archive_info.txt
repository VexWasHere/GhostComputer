Welcome, user!
This folder [should] contain files of old or scrapped ideas. This was made to show you the progress I've made over time (and not because I [accidentally] deleted all of my files).
I will include many things such as:
-Old files(original ideas)
-List of old ideas and thought process
-Friend's projects (Showing off their coding skills ._.)
-This file
-Random pictures
-Etc.

Btw, I might keep this when developing whatever python project I feel like. Just as a little joke.
Thank you and I hope you enjoy what's next to come!
